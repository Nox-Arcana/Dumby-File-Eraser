# Dumby-File-Eraser
The original purpose of this `.bat` file was to clear any trace of recent activity on your files; pretty much a little program that allowed you to quickly erase any trace of executed files such as (`.exe`, `.jar`, etc..).

After some extra stuff I added, it's pretty much a small cleaner that will delete temporary files & some other unnecessary stuff.




## What exactly does this batch file do?
This small script will **erase** the following:

- *Registry Files* (MUICache, Bags, MRU...)
- *Temp, %temp%, prefetch and recent*
- *Windows Event Logs*
